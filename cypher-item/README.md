## Some Notes on Items

### What feels good about ARPG items?
- Levels of rarity, increasing in power and difficulty to acquire
- Affixes = power
- The joy of things dropping
- Good gear *can* drop from anywhere, but great gear has places that can be target-farmed

### What can feel bad about ARPG items?
- Difficulty attributing value to random affixes
- Too many items, with very few of them worth picking up
- Durability sucks, get rid of it

### What do other ARPGs do that we should emulate?
- Last Epoch: deterministic crafting that doesn't detract from finding items
- Borderlands: affixes manifest as physical details on the item
